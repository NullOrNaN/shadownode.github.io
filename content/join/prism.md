## Prism Launcher

Prism is a third-party launcher not related to Microsoft, Mojang, CurseForge,  FTB. It can be used to launch vanilla Minecraft, custom Modpacks, FTB and CurseForge Modpacks. This launcher great for getting into modded Minecraft and providing a simple experience but also caters to power users. Prism run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### How to Install
Head to [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/download/) and download the Prism Launcher for your OS. The steps below are taken from a Windows install so it might be different if you're on macOS or Linux.

Once you've downloaded the launcher go to your downloads folder and open the installer and follow the instructions below to get setup.
1. In the launcher's base install screen click next till you see an option to create a desktop shortcut. We highly recommend creating one. You can do so by click the checkbox as shown below and then clicking next.

2. You can choose where to install the application, however, installing in a non-default location tends to cause problems. We recommend just hitting install.

3. Once this completes you can launch Prism by either searching for it on your computer or launching it from your Desktop.

### Adding Mod Packs
To be able to play Minecraft with Prism you still need to add a mod pack to the launcher and use it. You will need to know the pack you're looking to use as well as it's version. You can find the version and our packs in the [#welcome channel on our Discord](https://discord.shadownode.ca)

Once you've gotten *both* the pack and version number you'll need to add them using the launcher. In this example we'll be adding Direwolf20 1.19 from FTB.
1. Click Add Instance at the top of the Main Window

2. Once you do so, you'll have a new window popup and it'll show different Minecraft versions you can install. Choose CurseForge for any CurseForge packs and FTB For any FTB Packs. In the below example we're install DW20 1.19.

3. Once you select your pack and click OK to install it you will likely get prompted to install more mods that have to be downloaded by a browser, luckily, Prism can automatically manage this for you. Click the "Open Missing" button and then let it open all the mods and download them. Once that's done and all mods are downloaded, click "Ok" to continue with the installation.

4. When the modpack has finished downloading you'll see a screen similar to this. Double-click the launcher and your game should launch. If it doesn't you might need to edit your Java version for the pack. You can find the [correct version of Java](https://shadownode.net/home/guides/java-versions/) here.
