### Categories

![Store Nav](/assets/images/store/store_nav.png)
- Ranks/Rank Upgrades
    - These two categories are for changing your in-game prefix and giving you a few neat perks. No in-game features are locked or require you to have certain ranks to progress, these perks are all just quality-of-life enhancements like ```/feed```, ``/fly``, ``/back`` or multiple homes. See [rank overview](/server-info/ranks/) for all ranks and their perks.
- Claim Blocks
    - Here you can find a few kits of Claimblocks you can buy to extend the amount of space you have to build on the server. You can also get them by buying them in the ``/tokenshop`` as a vote reward.
- ChunkLoaders
    - A chunkloader keeps your base loaded while you are offline! They use a lot of server resources so we have to charge for this feature. See [chunk loaders](/home/guides/chunkloaders) for more detailed information about how to use the chunk loader plugin.
    - Chunkloaders when bought in the larger quantity packs are an area that is able to be loaded. For example the 5 radius option loads an area of 5x5 chunks.
- Misc. Items
    - "Pay What You Want" and "Pay What You Want Monthly" 
      - This item has no reward, so please only use this function if you really want to support us without expecting anything in return.
      - The standard "Pay What You Want" option is a single time contribution and "Pay What You Want Monthly" will automatically charge you on the same day every month for the amount you enter.
    - Send to Spawn 
      - Will attempt to send you to spawn on the selected server.

Crate Keys

    - Crates are kind of like an in game loot box. They give you a change to win a prize for an item that you may want.
    - To find out what is likely to be in a crate check out [the loot table](/home/guides/crates/).

{{% notice note%}}
All of these shop perks have commands that must be run on a 1.12 client to use. We recommend joining our lobby server at `play.shadownode.net` with a 1.12 Vanilla install to use them.
